Binary Search Tree Implementation in C
Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a Binary Search Tree (BST) in C. It includes functionalities for inserting nodes and performing in-order traversal of the tree. The program allows users to input a number of nodes, insert them into the tree, and then display the tree's in-order traversal.

Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are:

To understand and implement the basic concepts of a Binary Search Tree.
To provide functionalities for inserting nodes into the BST.
To perform and display the in-order traversal of the BST.
Features
Node Insertion: Allows users to insert nodes into the BST.
In-Order Traversal: Provides an in-order traversal of the BST to display the nodes in sorted order.
Components Used
Programming Language: C
Development Environment: Any C compiler (e.g., GCC)
